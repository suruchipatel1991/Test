Code designed for:
------------------
An IoT bases Smart Infrastructure, solves many basic problems and enhances efficient resource utilization. Looking at FIS, we have addressed some of the issues below.
1. Smart chair solves problem of dummy booking of a meeting room. Smart chairs can be used for efficient meeting room utilization. Sensors embedded with chairs in a meeting room can show the status of that meeting room as free or occupied. On basis of that availability of meeting rooms can be defined in outlook. 
2. Keep an eye on Employee's health conditions. Most of the health issues of an employee can also be tracked through a smart chair. Like weight, pulse rate, ECG, body posture, body movement etc. can be monitored and an alarm or trigger can be sent to employee’s PC.
3. Smart chairs also enable managers to track their employee’s productivity by tracking presence of employee on this desk.
4. Smart chairs in an office cafeteria will help for a better and comfortable place for employees.

Why it's cool
-------------

Smart management of meeting rooms, syncs with Outlook and solve problem of dummy bookings.
Employee's basic health check like ECG, pulse rate, heartbeat, weight etc are always available to him at his desk, no need to move to any health centre.
Saves time and energy to a great extent.
Very cheap, compact and readily available.
Current Infrastructure can be used to convert into an smart workplace.
